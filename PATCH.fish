set -l ROSE (set_color -o cf9bc2; or set_color normal)       # 🌸 Interface/Connection elements
set -l AZURE (set_color -o 89b4fa; or set_color normal)      # 💫 Quantum/Energy elements
set -l PEACH (set_color -o fab387; or set_color normal)      # 🌟 Starweave elements
set -l GOLD (set_color -o f9e2af; or set_color normal)       # 💫 Celestial/Energy elements
set -l MAROON (set_color -o eba0ac; or set_color normal)     # 🎆 Quantum Resonance elements

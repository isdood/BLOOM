# BLOOM Mobile Components

This directory contains mobile-specific integrations and abstractions for the BLOOM multi-device OS.
Many components here rely on STARWEAVE’s quantum stability and GLIMMER aesthetics for visual feedback.

## Structure

1. **build.zig**
   Provides build logic for the “bloom-mobile-ui” executable, managing quantum thread configuration,
   temporal synchronization checks, and GLIMMER-based logging mechanisms.

2. **hal/** (Hardware Abstraction Layer)
   - **touch.zig**: Implements quantum-aware touch handling with pressure sensitivity, crystal resonance,
     and maximum touch points.
   - **display.zig**: Manages display operations, including quantum coherence checks and glimmer-based
     pixel transformations.
   - **sensors.zig**: Collects sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) with quantum-state
     tracking for real-time updates.

3. **ui/** (User Interface)
   - **glimmer.zig**: Manages rendering layers, shaders, and effects with quantum coherence.
   - **elements.zig**: Handles UI elements, quantum-level animations, and synergy with STARWEAVE’s reality anchor.

## Key Points

- **Quantum Coherence & Crystal Resonance**
  Each module integrates quantum parameters (e.g., \`quantum_state\`, \`crystal_resonance\`) to maintain
  stable UI and input handling.

- **Documentation & Build**
  Build tasks (including tests and docs) are wired via \`build.zig\`.
  A quantum-aligned test engine ensures both functional correctness and reality synchronization.

- **Contributions**
  Contributions to individual modules should preserve GLIMMER coloring and quantum validations.
  Maintain logs with Azure, Lavender, Sage, and Rose color codes for consistent aesthetics.

# BLOOM Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BLOOM! These guidelines help maintain high quantum coherence, crystal stability, and overall project integrity.

## Getting Started
- **Quantum Coherence ≥ 0.95**: Ensure your changes preserve the quantum-framework integrity.
- **Crystal Stability**: Validate crystal-lattice interactions to maintain stable anchor points.
- **Recovery-Friendly**: Any feature added should gracefully handle fallback for misaligned realities.

## Code of Conduct
All contributors must follow our standard of respectful and open communication. Please review the [Code of Conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.

## Submitting Changes
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your enhancements.
2. Write clean, meaningful commits with concise messages.
3. Add tests for any new code paths, especially those involving quantum or crystal functions.
4. Raise a pull request outlining your changes, referencing any associated issues.

## Testing & Documentation
- **Quantum Tests**: Validate coherence. If possible, measure decoherence rates to confirm ≤ 5% drift.
- **Crystal-Lattice Tests**: Check memory usage, concurrency, and stability across anchored states.
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs (e.g., [Architecture](../architecture/QUANTUM-CRYSTAL-INTERFACE.md), [Bootloader](../bootloader/DESIGN.md)) to reflect changes.

## Project Coordination
- **Issues**: Discuss features or bugs in GitHub issues before sending a PR.
- **Pull Requests**: Link related issues, describe your changes, and include performance or coherence data when possible.
- **Communication**: Join the dev chat (if available) for quick feedback on your approach.

## Reality Anchoring Guidelines
- Always check for anchor alignment in new or modified modules.
- Validate that quantum-resonance scheduling remains within safe thresholds.

## Thank You
Quantifying the quantum realm and weaving stable crystals into mobile reality is no small feat. Your contributions keep BLOOM flourishing!

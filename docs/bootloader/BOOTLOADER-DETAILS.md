# BLOOM Multi-Stage Bootloader

Inspired by the highly modular approach in scribble, the BLOOM bootloader follows a similar multi-stage design, leveraging Zig for safety, performance, and quantum integration.

## Stage 1: Minimal Setup
During the first stage, the bootloader initializes critical hardware, sets up fundamental memory regions, and prepares for quantum anchor validation.

```zig
pub fn stage1_init() !void {
    // Basic hardware initialization
    // Reserve memory for quantum anchor structures
    // Minimal device checks, preparing to jump into stage 2
}
```

## Stage 2: Quantum Anchor & Crystal Integration
The second stage configures quantum anchor references and crystal-lattice memory regions, ensuring minimal decoherence before loading the main kernel or hypervisor interface.

```zig
pub fn stage2_quantum_anchor() !void {
    // Quantum anchor validation
    // Load crystal-lattice memory maps
    // Initialize secure random generation with quantum entropy
}
```

## Stage 3: Kernel/OS Load & Verification
Once quantum anchors are stable, the bootloader loads and verifies the kernel or OS layer, leveraging cryptographic checks supplemented by quantum-level entropy if available. This process is similar to scribble’s BL2 verification, adapted for BLOOM’s quantum approach.

```zig
pub fn stage3_load_kernel() !void {
    // Read kernel/OS image
    // Verify cryptographic signatures with extended quantum random data
    // Map the kernel/OS into memory
}
```

## Stage 4: Transition & Recovery Hooks
Finally, the bootloader hands off to the kernel or OS entry point and sets up recovery hooks. In the event a quantum anchor misalignment occurs, the system reverts to a safe fallback or triggers the recovery interface.

```zig
pub fn stage4_handoff() !noreturn {
    // Configure normal or fallback path
    // Transfer control to the main OS
    // Trigger fallback if reality anchor fails
    while (true) {}
}
```

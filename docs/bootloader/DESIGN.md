# BLOOM Multi-Stage Bootloader Design

The BLOOM bootloader is structured in multiple stages, each focusing on specific initialization tasks, hardware setup, and quantum integration. Inspired by the modular approach of the scribble project, it harnesses Zig features to maintain performance, safety, and high coherence.

## Stage 1: Minimal Setup
In this phase, we initialize critical hardware components, set up minimal memory allocations, and prepare for quantum anchor validation. This stage ensures the device is in a known, stable state before deeper operations begin.

```zig
pub fn stage1_init() !void {
    // Basic hardware initialization
    // Reserve memory for quantum anchor structures
    // Minimal device checks, preparing to jump into stage 2
}
```

## Stage 2: Quantum Anchor & Crystal Integration
With hardware stabilized, we load quantum anchor references and configure crystal-lattice memory for coherent operations. This ensures the bootloader benefits from quantum entropy and minimal decoherence before loading the primary system.

```zig
pub fn stage2_quantum_anchor() !void {
    // Quantum anchor validation
    // Load crystal-lattice memory maps
    // Secure random generation using quantum entropy
}
```

## Stage 3: Kernel/OS Load & Verification
Here the main OS or kernel is verified, leveraging cryptographic checks with quantum randomness for added entropy. This mimics scribble’s secure load approach while introducing BLOOM’s reality anchoring concepts.

```zig
pub fn stage3_load_kernel() !void {
    // Read kernel/OS image
    // Verify cryptographic signatures with quantum random data
    // Map the kernel/OS into memory
}
```

## Stage 4: Transition & Recovery Setup
Finally, control transitions to the kernel/OS entry point. If a misalignment in quantum or crystal states is detected, we revert to a safe fallback or invoke a specialized recovery mode, preventing data or coherence issues.

```zig
pub fn stage4_handoff() !noreturn {
    // Define normal or fallback path
    // Hand control to kernel/OS
    // Trigger fallback if reality anchor fails
    while (true) {}
}
```

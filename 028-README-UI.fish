    echo "# BLOOM Mobile Components"
    echo
    echo "This directory contains mobile-specific integrations and abstractions for the BLOOM multi-device OS."
    echo "Many components here rely on STARWEAVE’s quantum stability and GLIMMER aesthetics for visual feedback."
    echo
    echo "## Structure"
    echo
    echo "1. **build.zig**"
    echo "   Provides build logic for the “bloom-mobile-ui” executable, managing quantum thread configuration,"
    echo "   temporal synchronization checks, and GLIMMER-based logging mechanisms."
    echo
    echo "2. **hal/** (Hardware Abstraction Layer)"
    echo "   - **touch.zig**: Implements quantum-aware touch handling with pressure sensitivity, crystal resonance,"
    echo "     and maximum touch points."
    echo "   - **display.zig**: Manages display operations, including quantum coherence checks and glimmer-based"
    echo "     pixel transformations."
    echo "   - **sensors.zig**: Collects sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) with quantum-state"
    echo "     tracking for real-time updates."
    echo
    echo "3. **ui/** (User Interface)"
    echo "   - **glimmer.zig**: Manages rendering layers, shaders, and effects with quantum coherence."
    echo "   - **elements.zig**: Handles UI elements, quantum-level animations, and synergy with STARWEAVE’s reality anchor."
    echo
    echo "## Key Points"
    echo
    echo "- **Quantum Coherence & Crystal Resonance**"
    echo "  Each module integrates quantum parameters (e.g., \`quantum_state\`, \`crystal_resonance\`) to maintain"
    echo "  stable UI and input handling."
    echo
    echo "- **Documentation & Build**"
    echo "  Build tasks (including tests and docs) are wired via \`build.zig\`."
    echo "  A quantum-aligned test engine ensures both functional correctness and reality synchronization."
    echo
    echo "- **Contributions**"
    echo "  Contributions to individual modules should preserve GLIMMER coloring and quantum validations."
    echo "  Maintain logs with Azure, Lavender, Sage, and Rose color codes for consistent aesthetics."
